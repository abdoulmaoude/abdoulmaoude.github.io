      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif"> We present a simulation-based approach to approximate the asymptotic variance and asymptotic distribution function of two-stage estimators. We focus on extremum estimators in the second stage and consider a large class of estimators in the first stage. This class includes extremum estimators, high-dimensional estimators, and other types of estimators (e.g., Bayesian estimators). Importantly, the asymptotic distributions of both the first- and second-stage estimators may not be normal. Unlike resampling methods, our approach does not require multiple computations of the plug-in estimator. We show the effectiveness of our method using numerical simulations and empirical applications on real data.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">
        This paper proposes a peer effect model for counting variables using a game of incomplete information. I show that the game has a unique equilibrium under standard conditions. I also demonstrate that the identification argument in Bramoullé et al. (2009) extends to nonlinear models, particularly to the model of this paper. The model parameters are estimated using the Nested Partial Likelihood (NPL) approach, controlling for network endogeneity. I how that the linear-in-means/Tobit models with a counting outcome are particular cases of my model. However, by ignoring the counting nature of the outcome, these models can lead to inconsistent estimators. I use the model to evaluate peer effects on students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that a one-unit increase in the expected number of activities in which a student's friends are enrolled yields an increase in the expected number of activities in which the student is enrolled by 0.08. This point estimate using the Tobit model is three times higher.</p>

      <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">This paper investigates empirically the effects of climate and governments’ responses on the spread of the COVID-19. Our model is based on an accounting equation derived from the SIR model, and estimates the relationship between the growth of the daily COVID-19 confirmed cases on the one hand, and climatic variables (such as the daily average temperature and the wind speed) and governments responses to COVID-19 on the other hand. We also develop a theoretical approach to test the presence of a threshold in the effect of the temperature on the COVID-19 spread.</p>
